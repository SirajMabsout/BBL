coding in lebanese

This project i made in my Computer organization Course where we were required to translate some Lebanese coding syntax into assembly ARM v7

the syntax is as following:
2 sections : 1 for initializing variable (#tejhiz)| 1 for programming(#barmajeh)
it is indent based syntax where 4 spaces is required for the codes in the sections
within first section
          we can initialize up to 10 variables (10 regsters) by the syntax :    ra2m i = 3
          if the variable is previously initialized the code will tell you and change to the new variable
within second section
          we have if statments(iza) else if (aw iza) else (aw):
          after each if statment we indent by 4 more spaces
          and we can change the values of the registers(add ,subtract ,increment, decrement) by a number or previously initialized variable

And the code will run and display a graphical user interface that takes lines of lebanese statments and save the assembly output into your chosen directory
